<font face="Brush Script MT" size=4 color="purple"> My friends play an important role in my life because they support and encourage me everytime whether I'm having highs or lows. My first friends I value the most are the prudence section and my two bffs Luis and Enzo, from day one they helped me make my high school life better. They are the first people to motivate me to stay positive, especially during challenging times. Second circle of friends were my online friends, my most valued group friendship I've had. Moments are only through screens but the experiences and fun times with them are foremost the best I've ever been with. The final and last friendgroup I've had were the circle samuel made me join, they made me felt seen most of the time I'm glad I met them. Having friends like them makes my experiences more meaningful and memorable.
