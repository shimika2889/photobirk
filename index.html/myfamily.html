<font face="Comic sans MS">My mom supports me every day and continues to guide me in my life. My dad also supports me, even though our relationship is not as close as it was when I was younger. Despite this, I am still thankful for his care and support. I value my family and the memories from my childhood, which remain meaningful to me.
